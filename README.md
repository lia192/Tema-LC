Logical Expressions

    ArboreAbstract_FormaFinala.py:
    -converts the logical expression from relaxed syntax to strict syntax
    -checks whether the inserted logical expression is valid
    -displays the step of building the abstract tree of the logical expression
    -shows the truth table of the logical expression
 
    heuristic_algorithm_for_expression_simplification.py:
    -converts the logical expression from relaxed syntax to strict syntax
    -checks whether the inserted logical expression is valid
    -simplifies the logical expression using the laws of reduction, comutativity, associativity, idempotency, anihilation, distributivity and absortion
  
    QuineMcCluskey+Petricksalgorithmforminimizi.py:
    -converts the logical expression from relaxed syntax to strict syntax
    -checks whether the inserted logical expression is valid
    -simplifies the logical expression using the Quine-McCluskey algorithm using Petrick's method
   
    ResolutionMethod.py:
     -converts the logical expression from relaxed syntax to strict syntax
     -checks whether the inserted logical expression is valid
     -converts the logical expression to CNF
     -checks its satisfiability using the Resolution Method
     
    DavisPutnam.py:
     -converts the logical expression from relaxed syntax to strict syntax
     -checks whether the inserted logical expression is valid
     -converts the logical expression to CNF
     -checks its satisfiability using the Resolution Method with David Putnam's optimisation
     
    DPLL.py:
     -converts the logical expression from relaxed syntax to strict syntax
     -checks whether the inserted logical expression is valid
     -converts the logical expression to CNF
     -checks its satisfiability using DPLL
